# The Magnetar Activity GeNEraTOr (MAGNETO) Code
An astrophysics based Python code to simulate flaring activity of a magnetar using the Monte Carlo statistical technique. 
The MAGNETO code generates a sequence of flares from a single magnetar over its lifetime to determine how the time between two flares and flare energies evolve over the magnetar's age.


## Installation

To install the MAGNETO code, run the following commands in a terminal:
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Kushaalkumar-pothula/MAGNETO-Code.git
> cd MAGNETO-Code
> bash run.sh
```
Now you should have the MAGNETO code successfully installed on your computer. Now you can proceed to run the code.

## Usage
*Dependencies*: Python 3, NumPy and Matplotlib. 

## User Guide
