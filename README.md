# The Magnetar Activity GeNEraTOr (MAGNETO) Code
An astrophysics based Python code to simulate flaring activity of a magnetar using the Monte Carlo statistical technique. 
The MAGNETO code generates a sequence of flares from a single magnetar over its lifetime to determine how the time between two flares and flare energies evolve over the magnetar's age.


## Installation

To install the MAGNETO code, run the following commands in a terminal:
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Kushaalkumar-pothula/MAGNETO-Code.git
> cd MAGNETO-Code
```
Now you should have the MAGNETO code successfully installed on your computer. Now you can proceed to run the code.

## Usage
*Dependencies*: Python 3, NumPy and Matplotlib. 
There are two ways to run MAGNETO: By following the default method or the custom method. The custom method gives more freedom over physical parameters.
### Default
1. Open MAGNETO-Code directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
> run.sh
```
This will run the simulation with some default values of the magnetar's magntic field energy and power-law index.
